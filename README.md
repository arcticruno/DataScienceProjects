# DataScienceProjects

This is going to be an open repisitory for small data science projects
coded with Python or R. I am using this for practice purposes and hope
to get some deeper understanding of different data science techniques 
on a statistical or technical level.

Feel free to review my code. I am very open to learn from my mistakes.

All the best.
